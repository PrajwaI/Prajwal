# How I won a $3,250 scholarship for TKS
The Knowledge Society offered scholarship opportunities for upcoming students to reduce the cost of their program. I wanted to be part of the innovation that TKS is founded upon, although my application had been accpeted, the original price of the program made me deeply hesitate as the cost was around $5,000. 

When I found out about the scholarship opportunity, I knew I would have to strive for greatness if I wanted a reasonable chance of even part of the program. We were given two options for our scholarship: we had to create a video on improving the educational sector of TikTok or help Microsoft with creating energy-efficient data centers. Both options left me with great ideas; however, I chose the TikTok scholarship option instead, since I myself had a deeper hope for improving a platform that I, and my peers, use.

There were only a couple of days left to fill out the scholarshop form. I spent many hours brainstorming in order to come up with an idea of making a direct "for you" page related to educational content, which I named "learn." My idea also incorporated many more ideas, which can be seen through the video I created for the scholarship below.
