# CyberPatriots Semi-Finalists

During my Sophomore year, I joined Cyberpatriots with a group of friends to increase opportunities in the field of cybersecurity. I was already part of the Internet Technology magnet program at my school, so it felt like the next big step to be part of something related to the field.
My group, Cisco Chefs, completed a total of four completions related to CyberPatriots, round 1, round 2, states, and semi-finals. Although we did not go to the Nationals this year, we are working hard to improve for the year to come, as this was our first time competing. CyberPatriots has been a great opportunity to learn cybersecurity in a competitive group format.
