# CyberPatriots Semi-Finalists

My group, Cisco Chefs, completed a total of four completions related to CyberPatriots, round 1, round 2, states, and semi-finals. Although we did not go to the Nationals this year, we are working hard to improve for the year to come, as this was our first time competing. CyberPatriots has been a great opportunity to learn cybersecurity in a competitive group format.
