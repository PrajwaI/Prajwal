Hey! My name is Prajwal Shrestha, and I am a sophomore in Maryland attending the Internet Technology program at Eastern Technical High School. Alongside being a student at Eastern Technical High School, I am also a member of the Knowledge Society (TKS), where I work with industry leaders and companies to solve problems and innovate technologies.

While being an academically strong student, I have spent time learning game development and 3D modeling, generating tens of thousands of dollars through my process.
